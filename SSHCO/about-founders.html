                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">A Tale of Personal Tragedy and Trial</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                   <p>When I was about six years old, my parents were killed by Northern Sudanese Arab militias waging war on South Sudan. They entered my village, killing men and kidnapping women and children before burning our homes to the ground. That day, I lost my parents and several of my siblings. One of my sisters was carried away and, to this day, is thought to be a slave to an Arab Sudanese family in the north.<br><br>

                    I was lucky. Early that morning I had left with my older cousin, Michael, to take our goats and cows to find grass and water. When we heard the attack and saw the smoke coming from our burning village, we ran into a nearby forest to hide. For three days we remained in that forest alone, scared and hungry. From then on, Michael and I formed a special relationship. He became my protector during our thousand-mile journey to Ethiopia. When my legs got tired, he often carried me on his back for six or seven hours at a time. We could seldom rest. The Northern forces were constantly following us, so we often hid during the day and walked through the dangerous dark of the night. Lion attacks were a constant danger during the few times we had to rest. To protect ourselves when we rested, we made a timetable and decided who would sleep while the other was awake. One night while I was sleeping, a lion began attacking our group. Michael slapped me in the head very hard to wake me up. It was pitch black, and all I heard were people yelling, “Lion! Lion!” I jumped up and ran like a scared rabbit.  I couldn’t see where I was going, and I ran into the broken branch of a tree. It penetrated deep into my leg to the point where I could see my bone. There was no hospital. There was no first-aid kit. But there was Michael, and he helped me until my leg healed. Today, I look at the scar on my leg and think of everything Michael and I went through. When I look back, I can honestly say that Michael saved my life many times.<br><br>

                    When we both arrived in the U.S., Michael went to Nevada and I went to Michigan. I had become so dependent upon Michael that I was depressed by our separation. I remember calling Michael and asking him whether I should move to Nevada or if he would come to Michigan. Michael eventually moved to Michigan, and we supported each other through our journey -- not as Lost Boys, but as boys lost in a new country and culture. After high school, I went on to attend and graduate from Spring Arbor University. Michael joined the U.S. Marine Corps and served in Iraq. Of course, we remain very close to each other because we are more than family.</p>

                            <h2>Lual's Story</h2>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                   <p> Lual Deng Awan was born in the village of Maar, in the State of Jonglei, South Sudan.
When the nightmare of the Sudan/South Sudan Civil War fell upon him, he fled with thousands of other boys in the late 1980s. In 1992, he arrived in Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya.
<br><br>
Awan arrived in Lansing, Michigan on September 26, 2001. In 2007, he completed his general associate degree from Lansing Community College, and transferred to Michigan State University (MSU), where he completed an advance certificate in international development, minor degree in geography, and in a BA in economics in 2010. Currently, he is pursuing a master’s degree in economic geography at MSU. His main area of focus is economics potential and diversification in South Sudan with emphasis on agriculture, trade, infrastructure, energy, and general development. <br><br>
The civil war separated him from his parents when he was seven-years-old, and if parental care, love, and guidance matter in child’s rearing, then they are attributes of life that he has missed. However, Lual’s resiliency made him overcome his odds. He deeply benefitted from the caring, teamwork, encouragement, and advices that the Lost Boys of Sudan provided to each other in the refugee camps. The mutual bond taught him the importance of working together as a team and being a leader. In 2008, Lual Awan and his friend, Jacob Atem formed the Southern Sudan Healthcare Organization (SSHCO) to help improve healthcare services in South Sudan.
